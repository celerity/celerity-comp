CELERITY Compiler Repository
=========

**Celerity-comp** is a collection of LLVM passes and supporting code that interact with modern predictive optimizer and runtime systems.  It is designed to work both as a standalone library, as supporting external tool, and integrated within the Celerity runtime systems. It supports the new LLVM pass manager and does not implement the legacy one.
